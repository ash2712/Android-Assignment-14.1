Internal Storage is storage that exists directly on the device. Files saved to the internal storage are private to your application and other applications cannot access them. When the user uninstalls your application, these files are removed.
Every Android-compatible device supports a shared "external storage" that you can use to save files. This can be a removable storage media (such as an SD card) or an internal (non-removable) storage. Files saved to the external storage are world-readable and can be modified by the user when they enable USB mass storage to transfer files on a computer.
